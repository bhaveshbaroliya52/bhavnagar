    <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or 
    logical operations (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets 
    of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.</p>

      </svg>Computing and electronics</h2>
    <p>Computers and electronics play an enormous role in today's society, impacting everything from communication and medicine to science.

        Although computers are typically viewed as a modern invention involving electronics, computing predates the use of electrical devices. 
        The ancient abacus was perhaps the first digital computing device. Analog computing dates back several 
        millennia as primitive computing devices were used as early as the ancient Greeks and Romans, the most
         known complex of which being the Antikythera mechanism. Later devices such as the castle clock (1206),
          slide rule (c. 1624) and Babbage's Difference Engine (1822) are other examples of early mechanical
           analog computers.
        The introduction of electric power in the 19th century led to the rise of electrical and hybrid electro-mechanical devices to carry out both digital (Hollerith punch-card machine) and analog (Bushâ€™s differential analyzer) calculation. Telephone switching came to be based on this technology, which led to the development of machines that we would recognize as early computers.</p>
